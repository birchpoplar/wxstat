Histogram per day prior (relative) to actual day. - histogram is aggregate on error in F

How to compile histogram?

Compute difference in days from origin date to forecast date
Compute difference in F
increment

Create np.array for each day prior to actual (inc actual)
append difference in F to each np.array

#+begin_src python

from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Creating dataset
a = np.array([22, 87, 5, 43, 56,
			73, 55, 54, 11,
			20, 51, 5, 79, 31,
			27])

# Creating histogram
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize =(10, 7))
ax.hist(a, bins = [0, 25, 50, 75, 100])

# Show plot
plt.show()

#+end_src
